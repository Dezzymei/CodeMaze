# Code Maze

##### by Robert Desmond

This little game was inspired by my 6 year old son who likes solving mazes and also like instruction based robots. He started drawing this stuff out on paper and it inspired me to create something in code - and hence try out next.js!

This was started as a random small side project January 2022!

I am opensourcing this because I think it is fun - although at the time of writing I have also deployed it to https://code-maze.herokuapp.com/
